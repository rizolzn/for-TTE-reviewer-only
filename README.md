To demonstrate the functionality of our Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) platform and the real-time performance of the proposed controller, we provide a supplementary video of a representative test case. Please note that while the paper details results up to 100 km/h, the provided video showcases the system operation at 80 km/h due to testing site safety and confidentiality protocols for specific high-speed recording.
